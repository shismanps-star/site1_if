        The Special Theory of Relativity, introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905, describes the physics of objects moving at constant high speeds, especially close to the speed of light. It states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and does not depend on the motion of the source or the observer.
Its most famous result is the equation E = mc², which shows that mass and energy are interchangeable forms of the same physical quantity.

        <p class="text-secondary text-start">
         The General Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in 1915, describes gravity not as a force but as a curvature of space and time caused by mass and energy. According to this theory, massive objects bend the fabric of spacetime, and this curvature determines how objects move.

General relativity explains phenomena such as gravitational time dilation, the bending of light near massive bodies, and the expansion of the universe.

        <p class="text-secondary text-start">
        The Photoelectric Effect, explained by Albert Einstein, describes how light can cause electrons to be emitted from the surface of a metal. Einstein showed that light behaves as particles called photons, and each photon carries a specific amount of energy. When a photon hits the metal, it can transfer its energy to an electron and release it.

This discovery was crucial for the development of quantum theory and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
